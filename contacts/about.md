#  About Me

Most people are running behind AI because it’s popular.  
But I chose security — not because it’s easy, but because I feel it’s right for me.

I don’t follow the crowd.  
I try things, feel them, and then decide.  
When I like something, I give it 100%.  
No confusion. No copying others.

I’ve always loved technology.  
And when I found blockchain, something clicked.  
It’s not just about coding — it’s about solving trust, building systems, and thinking deep.  
It’s tough, but that’s what makes it worth it.

Security is the heart of all this.  
If you can protect it, you understand it.  
And that’s what I want — to really understand.

I believe knowledge matters.  
And I believe a man’s true strength shows when he makes the right choices in tough times.  
That’s when success follows.

My long-term goal is to start a startup —  
Not just to build something, but to **solve real-world problems** with tech.  
I want to **think different** and **create something meaningful**.

I know this path takes time.  
But I don’t care how long it takes.  
If I want it, I’ll do it — simple.

Mindset matters more than hype.  
Focus matters more than speed.  
And if you read all this closely…  
You’ll see it’s not just about tech. It’s about how I think.

Like a Nolan movie — you’ll get it better the second time. 🔐🌀
