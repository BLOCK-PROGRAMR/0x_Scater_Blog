<!-- # Rust Ownership its is special compare to other languages that's why rust is so unique

### Rust Ownership:
Rust‚Äôs ownership system is its unique way of managing memory without a garbage collector. It ensures memory safety at compile time and eliminates common bugs like dangling pointers or double frees.


## Heart of Rust Memory model three ownership rules:

1.Each value has a single owner
2.when the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped
3.A value can be moved, borrowed immutably any number of times, or borrowed mutably once.

### Moving Ownership:

```rust 
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello"); // s1 owns the String
    let s2 = s1; // ownership moves to s2

    // println!("{}", s1); // ‚ùå Error! s1 no longer owns the String
    println!("{}", s2); // ‚úÖ OK
}
```
## Explaination:
    1.s1 owns a string
    2.when we assign s1 to s2,ownership is moved not copied.
    3.s1 is now valid,Trying to use it will result compile time error


### Borrowing with references
If we don‚Äôt want to move ownership but just access the value, we use borrowing
```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    print_length(&s1); // pass a reference
    println!("{}", s1); // ‚úÖ still valid!
}

fn print_length(s: &String) {
    println!("Length is: {}", s.len());
}
```
## Explaination:
1.&s1 is an immutable reference 
2.Multiple immutable refernces allowed
3.The original owner (s1) retains ownership


### Mutable refernces only once allowed:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    change(&mut s); // mutable borrow
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn change(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str(", world");
}
```
## explaination:
1.only one mutable reference allowed at a time
2.This prevents data race at compile time

## If two mutable borrows at a time:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s; // ‚ùå Error: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time

    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
}
```

### Lifetimes:
 lifetimes are a way for the compiler to track how long references are valid to prevent dangling references (i.e., pointing to memory that‚Äôs been freed).
 Rust needs to know that any reference you return will live long enough to be valid. That‚Äôs where explicit lifetimes come in
 ### why Lifetime :
 ```rust
 fn get_str() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    &s // ‚ùå This won't compile!
}
 ```
 error:
 ```go
 error[E0515]: cannot return reference to local variable `s`

 ```
 Because s gets dropped when the function ends, returning a reference to it would be invalid.

 ## Why need lifetimes :
 ```rust
 fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("apple");
    let s2 = String::from("banana");

    let result = longest(&s1, &s2);
    println!("Longest: {}", result);
}

 fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
 ```

## About Lifetimes:

1.Lifetimes don‚Äôt change how your code runs ‚Äî they help the compiler validate reference safety.
2.You usually don‚Äôt have to write lifetimes because Rust can infer them.
3.You only need explicit lifetimes when:
     a.You return references from functions.
     b.You work with structs that hold references. -->


# üöÄ Understanding Rust Ownership: What Makes Rust Unique

Rust‚Äôs ownership model is what makes it stand out from other languages. Unlike languages that use garbage collection (like Java or Go), Rust enforces memory safety **at compile time** without needing a runtime.

---

## Rust Ownership: The Heart of Its Memory Model

Rust‚Äôs ownership rules ensure memory is managed safely and efficiently, eliminating common bugs like dangling pointers, data races, or double frees.

### üîí The Three Ownership Rules

1. **Each value in Rust has a single owner.**
2. **When the owner goes out of scope, the value is automatically dropped.**
3. **A value can be:**

   * moved,
   * borrowed immutably (any number of times),
   * or borrowed mutably (only once at a time).

---

##  Moving Ownership

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello"); // s1 owns the String
    let s2 = s1; // ownership moves to s2

    // println!("{}", s1); // ‚ùå Error! s1 no longer owns the String
    println!("{}", s2); // ‚úÖ OK
}
```

###  Explanation:

1. `s1` owns the string initially.
2. When assigned to `s2`, ownership is **moved**, not copied.
3. `s1` is now invalid; using it will cause a **compile-time error**.

---

## ü§Å Borrowing with References

If you want to access data without taking ownership, **borrow** it using references.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    print_length(&s1); // Pass a reference
    println!("{}", s1); // ‚úÖ Still valid!
}

fn print_length(s: &String) {
    println!("Length is: {}", s.len());
}
```

### Explanation:

1. `&s1` is an **immutable reference**.
2. You can have **multiple** immutable references at the same time.
3. `s1` retains ownership.

---

##  Mutable References (Only One at a Time)

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    change(&mut s); // Mutable borrow
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn change(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str(", world");
}
```

###  Explanation:

1. Only **one mutable reference** is allowed at a time.
2. This rule prevents **data races** at compile time.

---

##  What Happens If You Try Two Mutable Borrows?

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s; // ‚ùå Error: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time

    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
}
```

Rust will stop this code from compiling, ensuring safe access.

---

##  Lifetimes in Rust

**Lifetimes** are how Rust ensures that references are always valid. They don‚Äôt change how long data lives ‚Äî they simply **tell the compiler** how long a reference is guaranteed to be valid.

---

###  Why Are Lifetimes Needed?

Here‚Äôs an example that doesn‚Äôt compile:

```rust
fn get_str() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    &s // ‚ùå Error!
}
```

**Error:**

```
error[E0515]: cannot return reference to local variable `s`
```

This fails because `s` is dropped when the function ends ‚Äî returning a reference to it would be a **dangling pointer**.

---

###  Example Using Lifetimes

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("apple");
    let s2 = String::from("banana");

    let result = longest(&s1, &s2);
    println!("Longest: {}", result);
}

fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

* `'a` is a **lifetime annotation** that says:

  * The returned reference will be valid as long as both input references are.
* You must write lifetimes when the compiler can‚Äôt infer them ‚Äî especially when returning references from a function.

---

## üìö Lifetimes 

1. Lifetimes help Rust verify reference safety at compile time.
2. Most of the time, Rust **infers lifetimes** for you using *lifetime elision rules*.
3. You need to explicitly annotate lifetimes when:

   * Returning references from functions.
   * Working with structs that store references.

---

##  Summary

* Rust's ownership and borrowing system manages memory **without a garbage collector**.
* You can **move**, **borrow**, or **mutably borrow** values, but under strict rules.
* Only one mutable reference allowed at a time to avoid data races.
* Lifetimes ensure references stay valid, especially when returning them from functions.
* Most of the time, you don‚Äôt need to write lifetimes manually ‚Äî but when you do, they make your code **safe and predictable**.
